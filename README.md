# FaceLock

Face detection and tracking software using Java, Arduino Uno, and OpenCV (https://opencv.org/).

FaceLock is able to capture a human face using AI and neural networks.
It take these captured images and processes the coordinates, then sends them to the Arduino.
From there the Arduino tells a pair of servos where to position themselves to keep track of
the person it has locked onto.
